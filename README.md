# IP Address prefix finder
This small Go application gets the first three subdivisions of an IP address. <br>
For example, 34.240.50.53 would output 34.240.50 <br>
This is useful in web analytics as a user might get reassigned a network IP address, and the last subdivision changes, but you want to associate the tracking of the new IP address with the old.
